# PayFund

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Stripe payment processing in the PayFund Flutter application. The goal is to provide a seamless payment experience using Stripe's APIs.

## Features
- Integration of Stripe in a Flutter mobile app using the `flutter_stripe` package.
- Examples of creating payment intents and processing payments.
- Support for secure and scalable payment workflows.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Flutter SDK** installed. [Install Flutter](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install)
- **Stripe Account** with API keys. [Get started with Stripe](https://stripe.com/)
- A mobile device or emulator for testing the Flutter app.

### Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd payfund
```

### Flutter Setup

1. Navigate to the Flutter app folder:
   ```bash
   cd flutter_app
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```
3. Configure Stripe public key in the app's configuration file (e.g., `lib/config.dart`):
   ```dart
   const String stripePublishableKey = '<your-publishable-key>';
   ```
4. Initialize `flutter_stripe` in your app's main file (e.g., `main.dart`):
   ```dart
   import 'package:flutter_stripe/flutter_stripe.dart';

   void main() {
     Stripe.publishableKey = '<your-publishable-key>';
     runApp(MyApp());
   }
   ```
5. Run the app:
   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Testing

- Use a test card provided by Stripe to simulate payments.
- Examples of test cards are available in [Stripe's documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/testing).
